##Why
Building a vimrc file can be challenging and time consuming. There are so many commands you could do, and remembering what they all mean can be impossible.

Yet having a vimrc is nearly critical if it's your primary text editor. Certain things should have just been built in, but they are not.

Example: `syntax on` in your vimrc enables syntax hilighting

## Installation
```shell
npm run newb
```
